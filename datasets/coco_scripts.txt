EXT. MARIGOLD PATH - DUSK

      A path of marigold petals leads up to an altar lovingly
      arranged in a humble cemetery. An old woman lights a candle
      as the smoke of burning copal wood dances lyrically upward...

      The smoke lifts up toward lines of papel picado  - cut paper
      banners -- that sway gently in the breeze.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Sometimes I think I'm cursed...
                  'cause of something that happened
                  before I was even born.

      A story begins to play out on the papel picado.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  See, a long time ago there was this
                  family.

      The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a
      father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  The pap , he was a musician.

      The pap  plays guitar while the mother dances with her
      daughter.

                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  He and his family would sing, and
                  dance, and count their blessings...
                      (beat)
                  But he also had a dream... to play
                  for the world.
                      (beat)
                  And one day he left with his
                  guitar... and never returned.

      The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In
      another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching
      her pap  leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her
      mam , hardened.

      She shuts the door.
