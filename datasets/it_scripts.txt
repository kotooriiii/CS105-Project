OPEN ON:
                         
          Rain. Lashing a windowpane. A PIANO PLAYS somewhere off
          screen. Beethoven's Fur Elise.
                         
                         
          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          A little boy gazes out into the storm. Nervous, eager, sweet.
          Meet GEORGE DENBROUGH (9).
                         
                                              GEORGE
                     You sure it's not too bad out
                     there?
                         
          Will (13), his older brother,   sits up in bed propped against
          a pile of pillows, surrounded   by tissues and sheets of
          newspaper. HEADLINES and TOYS   tell us this is the late 80's --
          October, 1987 to be exact. He   puts finishing touches on
                         
          A PAPER BOAT
                         
                                              WILL
                     Don't be such a wuss. I'd come if I
                     weren't dying. Now get the
                     paraffin.
                         
                                              GEORGE
                     In the cellar?
                         
                                              WILL
                     You want it to float or not,
                     Georgie? Go on. Storm's not gonna
                     last forever.
                         
                                              GEORGE
                     Okay, Willy.
                         
          George jumps up obediently and goes.
